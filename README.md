# Quadrattic Equation for the TI-Nspire calculator (ARCHIVED)


### History
I never realy liked school work, and prefered computers to book work.
For some fun I created this app for my graphical caculator while in math class.
My teacher did tell me that I would be unable to use this in the exam (yr 10) or Year 12 Final Exam.
I didn't really care, I couldn't be bothered writing out all the workings and indvidully caculating the information,
So I created this app to display the workings and annswer in one nice neat package.

All you required to do was to place in the a, b and c values and it would work out the rest.


ie.

quad_equ(1,2,0);
+-x = (sqrt(b^2-4ac)/2a

### NOTE:
I haven't used a TI-Nspire calculator since I fnished school, and have no idea if this will work with the new TI caculators.

This is for archival purposes.

I do play on re-writing this as either python or just the function in plain text, for those who wish to view what is was originally doing.
